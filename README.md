This script, ‘run_analysis.R’ has been written for the peer assessment project. It has been divided into sections separated by comments explaining each of the sections. 

The script is divided into the following sections:

1. Read Activity Labels and Features list into datasets
2. Read Test Data into a data frame, while merging with the Activity Names and Features (as column names)
3. Repeat 2 for Training Data
4. Merge Training and Test Datasets
5. Extract only measurements on the mean and std deviation for each measurement
6. Create an independent tidy dataset according to specifications in the project question
7. Write tidy dataset to file
